## Description
A book search application refactored from a RESTful API to use a GraphQL API and Apollo Server. Refactoring this code made me much more confident in my use of GraphQL, and I had a lot of experience with fixing small bugs in the code.

## Installation
Navigate to ```./book-search```

Run the following command from the terminal: 

```npm run install```

## Usage
This application is deployed to Heroku at [mels-book-search.herokuapp.com](https://mels-book-search.herokuapp.com/). 

To run the application for development on a local server, follow the following steps: 

1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and set up on your computer before using this application. A guide can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

2. Navigate to ```./book-search```

3. Open a new terminal and run the following command:

```npm run develop```
